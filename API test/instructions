Here is a little API coding project I put together. The app should pull "content deliverable" records from the Content Deliverables 
table with certain criteria listed below. I just need you to create a basic web page using HTML (no CSS needed) that contains an H1 
with the Client name that is pulled from the Quick Base API (see documentation here).   https://developer.quickbase.com/operation/runQuery

--------------------------------------------------------
Realm Hostname	= emsearchconsulting.quickbase.com

Table ID	= brdqbafdp

App ID	= dqdx7nvxe69y868c3b6d27dyun

User Token	= b4bq6v_mq3e_0_cy4nht5c99yx27czj67bmcud86iy
---------------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

Using jQuery, pull “Content Deliverable” records with the following parameters or “filters”. Note: “fid:x” is the ‘field id’ number in the database:


`Field name` (fid:n) = value

`Related Content Deliverable Allocation` (fid:22)	= 582

`Stage` (fid:6)	= “Sent to client for approval”





HTML table should appear with these columns:


`Publish Date` (fid:8)

`Topic` (fid:37)

`Assigned to (default)` (fid:33)

`Content URL (google docs)` (fid:7) (use this as href in anchor tag wrapped around Title value)

`Content Deliverable Allocation - Product - Client Name` (fid:23)


The page should look something like this:

Client Name

[[[Table with columns/rows mentioned in the instructions above]]]
